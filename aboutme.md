My name is James. I am a developer, actor, gamer, and kind of a nerd.
I only do things that look fun to me, and that could mean YOU! 
Okay, that sounded more creepy than it was supposed to.

I mainly program in Java, C#, and PHP.
I really don't care what you think of any of it.
I mainly code for myself, and if you get some use out of it, that's a plus!
